If using raw bones, you can brown them first using the Sauté function, or roast in oven at 400°F for better flavor, roast for 30-45 minutes\n\n2. Put bones and all ingredients in the Instant Pot\n\n  - For chicken bones: cook on HIGH pressure for 2-3 hours\n\n  - For beef/pork bones: cook on HIGH pressure for 3-4 hours\n\n3. Let pressure release naturally (about 30 minutes)\n\n4. Strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth\n\n5. Once cooled, you can remove the fat layer from the top if desired\n\nTips:\n\n- Don't fill past the max line - bones and water expand during cooking\n\n- You can reuse the same bones 2-3 times (just add fresh vegetables each time)\n\n- Store in fridge up to 5 days or freeze up to 6 months\n\n- For maximum nutrition, add any vegetable scraps you've saved\n\nWould you like me to explain any part in more detail?\n\n**cold veggie smoothie**\n\n**Cooked Broccoli Smoothie Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n• **1 cup cooked, cold broccoli** (steamed or boiled, then cooled)\n\n• **1 ripe banana** (adds natural sweetness)\n\n• **1/2 cup plain or vanilla yogurt** (for creaminess and a slight tang)\n\n• **1/2 cup cold water or milk** (adjust for desired thickness)\n\n• **Ice cubes** (4–5, or as needed)\n\nIce cubes in a smoothie serve a few purposes:\n\n**1. Cooling the Smoothie**\n\n• Ice chills the smoothie, making it refreshing and enjoyable, especially on warm days.\n\n• If you’re using fresh (non-frozen) ingredients, ice is essential for that cold, slushy texture.\n\n**2. Adding Thickness**\n\n• Blending ice cubes creates a thicker, frothy texture. It gives the smoothie more body without needing extra ingredients like frozen fruit or yogurt.\n\n• Perfect for those who prefer their smoothies more milkshake-like.\n\n**3. Diluting Intense Flavors**\n\n• Ice slightly dilutes strong or earthy flavors (like broccoli or kale), balancing the taste.\n\n• This is helpful if you’re experimenting with veggies in your smoothie and want to tone down their intensity.\n\n**Alternatives to Ice Cubes**\n\nIf you don’t want to use ice, try:\n\n1. **Frozen Broccoli**: Use frozen, cooked broccoli instead of fresh.\n\n2. **Frozen Banana**: Slice and freeze the banana beforehand for a creamy, cold smoothie.\n\n3. **Frozen Yogurt Cubes**: Freeze portions of yogurt in an ice tray for added creaminess.\n\nAdding ice cubes is optional, but they can transform the texture and temperature, making the smoothie more refreshing and palatable! 😊\n\n**cookies**\n\nClassic Vanilla Extract Cookies:\n\n2½ cups white flour\n\n1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n\n1 cup granulated sugar \n\n2 large eggs\n\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n½ teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

They'll be soft in center, slightly crisp edges.\n\nreduce this recipe, because my pan is smaller\n\nPerfect size - the 1.7 inch scoop will let you fit 6 cookies easily on your 11x9 pan with proper spacing. For proper spreading, reduce recipe to:\n\n1¼ cups flour ½ cup butter ½ cup sugar 1 egg 1 tsp vanilla ½ tsp baking soda ¼ tsp salt\n\nBake 8-10 minutes at 350°F.\n\n**dehydrating yam**\n\nshould snap so not bend because little bit of moisture will cause it to mold\n\nadd oxygen absorber, to prolong freshness\n\n**dumplings**\n\nFor the easiest homemade dumplings:\n\n1. Mix 2 cups flour with ¾ cup warm water to make the dough. Knead until smooth, rest 30 minutes.\n\n2. For filling: Combine ground pork (or vegetables), minced cabbage, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil.\n\n3. Roll dough into small circles, place filling in center, fold and pinch edges to seal.\n\n4. Boil in water for 3-4 minutes until they float, or pan-fry (potsticker style) for 4-5 minutes.\n\nOr for the simplest option, buy pre-made dumpling wrappers from an Asian grocery store and just focus on making the filling.\n\n**fish**\n\nMade With Lau\n\nfrozen Alaskan code\n\nMarianne\n\ngarlic, chop off hard end, smash\n\nmince the garlic, chop at multiple angles\n\nsmash ginger, chop\n\ngreen onion, smash, then mince\n\ngarlic salt (1 tablespoon - more), sugar (1tsp), 1/4 tsp white ppper, 2 tsp cornstarch, 1 tsp of cooking wine\n\nMix everything\n\ndefrost the fish, then paper towel to dry it, put it to a bowl\n\nthen mix the seasoning, no need to add soy sauce because the fish is white, keep it white\n\nsyut jyu \n\nsoy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar for the dipping sauce add some chili sauce\n\nAdd some oil and mix to the fish\n\nadd some aluminum foil down, add some oil , the oil will cook the fish, and will not stick to the aluminum foil\n\nthen add the mariande to the top of the fish\n\nthen to the air frier\n\n400 degrees , need to use high heat (even with pan fry , faster to cook more moisture inside)\n\nthen add some more oil after it's been in oven for 6 minutes \n\nthen 5 minutes, internal temp 130 - 135 degrees\n\nDefrosting: That’s pretty common advice on  and similar subs. Thawing in a vacuum bag creates an anaerobic environment that’s ideal for some particular fish pathogen. Especially if you’re going to eat it raw, remove from the vacuum bag, wrap in food quality paper towels (), bag and refrigerate until thawed, leave it in the fridge overnight. \n\n**Kimchi**\n\n\t\t1 medium head napa cabbage (about 2 pounds)\n\n\t\t1/4 cup iodine-free sea salt or kosher salt (see Recipe Notes)\n\n\t\tWater, preferably distilled or filtered\n\n\t\t1 tablespoon grated garlic (5 to 6 cloves)\n\n\t\t1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger\n\n\t\t1 teaspoon granulated sugar\n\n\t\t2 tablepoons fish sauce or salted shrimp paste, or 3 tablespoons water\n\n\t\t1 to 5 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes ()\n\n\t\t8 ounces Korean radish or daikon radish, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\n\t\t4 medium scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces\n\nMain thing is to salt, then add water, then wait, then rinse, then make the sauce, \n\nI'll help you create traditional kimchi (kimchi-guk). Here's a detailed recipe:\n\nFor the vegetables:\n\n1 large Napa cabbage (about 3-4 pounds), cut into 2-inch pieces\n\n1/4 cup sea salt\n\n2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)\n\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 tablespoon grated ginger\n\n2 tablespoons fish sauce\n\n2 tablespoons salted shrimp (saeujeot), minced (optional)\n\n1 Asian pear, grated\n\n4 green onions, chopped\n\n1/4 cup white onion, minced\n\n2 tablespoons sugar\n\n1 medium daikon radish, julienned\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

This concept is particularly relevant for individuals with diabetes, where managing blood sugar levels is crucial. Here's a deeper dive into the relationship between carbohydrates and diabetes:\n\n### How Carbohydrates Affect Diabetes\n\n1. **Carbohydrate Metabolism:**\n\n   - **Glucose Production:** When you consume carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. This process raises blood sugar levels.\n\n   - **Insulin Response:** Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream to use for energy or store for later use. In diabetes, insulin production is either impaired (Type 1) or cells become resistant to insulin's effects (Type 2).\n\n2. **Types of Carbohydrates:**\n\n   - **Simple Carbs:** Found in sugars and processed foods, simple carbs are quickly absorbed, leading to rapid spikes in blood sugar.\n\n   - **Complex Carbs:** Found in whole grains, vegetables, and legumes, these carbs are digested more slowly, causing a gradual increase in blood sugar levels.\n\n3. **Glycemic Index (GI):**\n\n   - Foods are often categorized by their glycemic index, which measures how quickly carbohydrates in a food raise blood sugar levels. High-GI foods cause quick spikes, while low-GI foods result in a slower, more gradual increase.\n\n### Managing Carbohydrate Intake in Diabetes\n\n1. **Monitoring Carbohydrate Intake:**\n\n   - **Carb Counting:** Many individuals with diabetes use carb counting to manage their blood sugar levels. This involves tracking the number of carbohydrates consumed at each meal and adjusting insulin doses accordingly.\n\n   - **Portion Control:** Understanding portion sizes can help maintain blood sugar levels within the target range.\n\n2. **Choosing Low-Glycemic Foods:**\n\n   - Emphasizing low-GI foods can lead to more stable blood sugar levels. Examples include whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables.\n\n3. **Balancing Macronutrients:**\n\n   - A balanced diet with appropriate amounts of protein and healthy fats can slow carbohydrate absorption, providing more stable blood sugar levels.\n\n### Myths and Misunderstandings\n\n1. **\"All Carbs Are Bad\":**\n\n   - Not all carbohydrates negatively impact blood sugar. Whole foods with fiber, vitamins, and minerals can be part of a healthy diet.\n\n2. **Complete Elimination of Carbs:**\n\n   - While reducing carb intake can help some individuals manage their diabetes, complete elimination isn't necessary or advisable. Carbs are essential for energy and various bodily functions.\n\n3. **Individualized Approaches:**\n\n   - Each person's diabetes management plan should be tailored to their specific needs, preferences, and medical advice.\n\n### The Role of Diet in Diabetes Management\n\n1. **Low-Carb Diets:**\n\n   - Some studies suggest that low-carb diets can improve blood sugar control and reduce reliance on medication for some individuals with Type 2 diabetes.\n\n2. **Mediterranean and DASH Diets:**\n\n   - Diets like the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which focus on whole foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats, have shown positive effects on blood sugar management.\n\n3. **Medical Supervision:**\n\n   - It's essential for individuals with diabetes to work with healthcare professionals, such as dietitians and endocrinologists, to create a sustainable and effective dietary plan.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile carbohydrates do play a role in raising blood sugar levels, the key to managing diabetes is understanding how different types of carbs affect the body and finding a balanced, individualized approach to diet. Making informed food choices, monitoring intake, and working closely with healthcare providers can help manage diabetes effectively.\n\n",
