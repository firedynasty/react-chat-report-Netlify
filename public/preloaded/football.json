  "02-concepts.md": "## Dagger Concept\n\n**Dagger** is a two-route combination that attacks the middle of the field:\n\n### The Core Routes\n1. **Deep Dig/Over** - 15-20 yards across the field\n2. **Vertical Seam/Post** - Up the seam\n\nThese two routes create a **high-low stretch** on the middle linebacker or safety.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**The Conflict:**\n- The seam holds the deep safety\n- The dig comes in behind the linebackers\n- Middle defender can't cover both\n\n**Common Read:**\n1. Peek at the seam (is safety jumping it?)\n2. Main read is the dig behind it\n3. Checkdown if both covered\n\n## Visual Example\n```\n        FS\n         |\n    ----DIG----> (15-20 yards)\n         |\n         |\n    SEAM/POST\n         |\n        MLB\n```\n\n## In Your Play List\n\n**\"Sft Mtn PA Dagger Cross\"** likely means:\n- Play action fake\n- Someone runs the deep dig/cross\n- Someone else runs the seam\n- \"Cross\" might indicate the dig comes from across formation\n\n**Related concepts in your list:**\n- **PA Deep Cross Go** - Similar deep cross with vertical\n- **PA Post Dig** - Exactly dagger (post + dig)\n\n## Why \"Dagger\"?\n\nThe deep dig \"stabs\" through the middle of the defense like a dagger - it's the primary route that kills defenses when the seam holds the safety!\n\nGreat question! Now you're getting into the actual play calling after establishing the formation and motion. Here's how route calling typically works:\n\n## Route Tree Numbers (Most Common System)\n\n**Standard numbering**:\n- 0 = Hitch (quick stop)\n- 1 = Quick slant\n- 2 = Slant \n- 3 = Deep out\n- 4 = Deep in (dig)\n- 5 = Deep comeback\n- 6 = Deep curl\n- 7 = Corner/flag\n- 8 = Post\n- 9 = Go/Fly/Streak\n\n## Calling Routes in Your Formation\n\n**Your setup**: Trey left, offset right, fly motion left, X isolated right\n\n**Common ways to call it**:\n\n### Number System\n\"**324**\" might mean:\n- Trey side (3 receivers): Outside runs \"3\" (deep out)\n- Middle receiver: Runs \"2\" (slant)\n- Inside receiver: Runs \"4\" (dig)\n- X receiver (alone): Runs specific route or converts\n\n### Concept Names\nInstead of numbers, many teams use **concept names**:\n- **\"Smash\"** = Corner/hitch combo\n- **\"Flood\"** = 3 levels vertical stretch\n- **\"Mesh\"** = Crossing routes\n- **\"Four Verts\"** = All verticals\n\n## Full Play Call Example\n\n**\"Trey Left, Offset Right, Fly Motion Left, 324 Flood, X Curl\"**\n\nBreaking it down:\n- Formation: Trey left\n- Backfield: Offset right\n- Motion: Fly left\n- Trey routes: 3-2-4 concept\n- Backside: Flood concept\n- X receiver: Runs curl\n\n## Protection Calls\n\nOften tagged at end:\n- **\"525 protection\"** (5 blockers, RB responsible for Mike)\n- **\"Jet protection\"** (RB free releases)\n- **\"Max protect\"** (7-8 blockers)\n\nThe beauty is each system is different - some teams name every route concept (\"Dagger,\" \"Scissor,\" \"Lion\"), while others use pure numbers. The key is everyone knowing their assignment within the system.\n\nThis sounds like a classic **\"Yankee Concept\"** or **\"Deep Cross\"** play with a TE delay element. Let me break down what you're describing and give you the proper name:\n\n## The Play Breakdown\n\n**Formation**: Trips Left\n**Routes**:\n- #1 (outside): Post\n- #2 (middle slot): Cross \n- #3 (inside slot): Cross\n- TE: Block 1 second, then release to corner\n\n## The Play Name Options\n\n**Most likely: \"PA Yankee Delay\"**\n- \"Yankee\" = Deep crossing concept\n- \"Delay\" = TE blocks then releases\n\n**Could also be called**:\n- **\"PA Deep Cross Leak\"**\n- **\"PA Double Cross Y-Delay\"**\n- **\"PA Trips Yankee Corner\"**\n\n## Why \"Yankee\"?\n\n**Traditional Yankee Concept**:\n- Deep over/crossing route from one side\n- Deep dig/cross from the other\n- Creates horizontal stretch on safeties\n- Your version has double crossers from trips\n\n## The TE \"Delay\" Element\n\n**TE Corner Delay**:\n- Blocks for 1 count (sells pass pro)\n- Then releases to corner route\n- This is the \"leak\" or \"delay\" tag\n- Often WIDE open as defenders forget about him\n\n## Full Play Call\n\n**\"Trips Left, 21 PA Boot, Yankee Y-Delay Corner\"**\n\nOr simplified:\n**\"PA Yankee Delay\"** (everyone knows their job)\n\n## Why This Works\n\nThe crossing routes clear out the middle and pull safeties down, while the TE delay often leaves him 1-on-1 with a linebacker who can't cover the corner route. The post holds the deep safety. It's a great shot play off play action!\n\n\nPerfect! Now I can see the actual **Yankee concept** drawn up. Let me break down what you're showing:\n\n## Formation Breakdown\n\n**\"12 Personnel, 2x2 TE Splits, Gun Sidecar Right\"**\n- **12 Personnel**: 1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs\n- **Formation**: Both TEs split out (not attached to line)\n- **Backfield**: Shotgun with RB in sidecar (parallel to QB on right)\n\n## The Yankee Concept Routes\n\nLooking at your diagram:\n- **Z (left)**: Deep over/post route (blue line)\n- **Y (TE left)**: Shallow cross underneath (red arrow)\n- **U (TE right)**: Deep cross/over (green dashed line)  \n- **X (right)**: Likely converting to deep route\n- **RB (T)**: Check protection or outlet (orange)\n\n## The Play Call\n\n**\"12 Gun Sidecar Right, 2x2 TE Splits, Yankee\"**\n\nOr more concise:\n**\"12 Spread Gun, Yankee Right\"**\n\n## Why This Version Works\n\n**The Concept**:\n- **High-Low-Middle triangle** on the linebackers\n- Y (TE) on shallow cross holds underneath coverage\n- U (TE) on deep cross attacks middle behind LBs\n- Z on post/over occupies safety\n- Creates horizontal stretch across field\n\n**TE Advantages**:\n- Both TEs split out creates matchup problems\n- Likely getting LBs in coverage\n- TEs on crossing routes are tough to cover\n- More physical on breaking routes\n\n**\"Yankee Right\"** indicates the direction of the primary deep cross (coming from right to left in this case).\n\nThis is a great intermediate passing concept that attacks the middle of the field at multiple levels!\n\n/Users/stanleytan/Documents/21-notes/03-hobbies/01-football\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, exactly! That's the **concept name** - one word that tells ALL receivers their complete route package.\n\n## Concept Names = Complete Route Packages\n\nWhen the QB says **\"Smash\"**, every receiver instantly knows:\n\n**Smash Concept:**\n\n- \\#1 receiver (outside): Corner route\n- \\#2 receiver (inside): Hitch/Quick game\n- Creates high-low stretch on corner\n\n**No need to say:** \"X run corner, Z run hitch, slot run hitch\" - just say **\"Smash\"**!\n\n## Common NFL Concept Names\n\n**\"Four Verts\"**\n\n- Everyone: Vertical routes\n- Inside receivers have option rules\n\n**\"Mesh\"**\n\n- Two receivers: Crossing routes that \"mesh\"\n- Others: Specific complementary routes\n\n**\"Flood\"**\n\n- Three receivers: Short, medium, deep to one side\n- Creates 3-level vertical stretch\n\n**\"Dagger\"**\n\n- Slot: Deep dig/over\n- Outside: Vertical seam\n- Everyone knows their role\n\n**\"Stick\"**\n\n- \\#1: Hitch\n- \\#2: \"Stick\" route (quick out)\n- \\#3: Flat\n\n## How This Speeds Everything Up\n\n**Instead of:** \"X run 9, Z run 5, Slot run 2, TE run 6, RB check protect then release to flat\"\n\n**Just say:** \"Flood\" - everyone knows their job!\n\n## Team-Specific Names\n\nSome teams get creative:\n\n- **\"Tiger\"** = Their version of Smash\n- **\"Lion\"** = Their Flood concept\n- **\"Seattle\"** = Four Verts\n- **\"NASCAR\"** = Speed sweep package\n\nThe beauty is during install week, you learn \"when we call Smash, I run X route from Y position\" - then in the game, one word triggers everyone's assignment. It's like calling a basketball play where \"UCLA\" means everyone knows their cuts and screens!\n\n\n\nGreat question! In **\"Motion Smash Sluggo\"**, the \"Smash\" is likely telling you the **base concept** that most receivers run, while \"Sluggo\" is a **special tag** for one specific receiver.\n\n## Breaking It Down\n\n**\"Motion Smash Sluggo\"** probably means:\n\n**Base Concept: \"Smash\"**\n\n- Most receivers run normal Smash routes\n- \\#2 receivers: Hitches/quick game\n- But ONE receiver gets a different route...\n\n**Tagged Route: \"Sluggo\"**\n\n- The #1 (outside) receiver runs Sluggo instead of corner\n- Sluggo = Slant-and-Go (fake slant, break vertical)\n- This replaces the normal corner route in Smash\n\n## Why This Makes Sense\n\n**Normal Smash:**\n\n- Outside: Corner\n- Inside: Hitch\n\n**Smash-Sluggo:**\n\n- Outside: **SLUGGO** (the changeup)\n- Inside: Hitch (stays the same)\n\n## The Advantage\n\n**Defensive Expectation:**\n\n- They see Smash formation/split\n- Corner expects normal corner route\n- Jumps the corner break\n\n**The Sluggo Surprise:**\n\n- Receiver sells slant first (corner bites)\n- Then breaks vertical\n- Wide open deep\n\n## How It's Called\n\nThe full concept is \"Smash\" but with the \"Sluggo\" **tag** or **alert** changing one specific route. So:\n\n- 3 receivers might run regular Smash\n- 1 receiver (usually backside X or frontside Z) runs the Sluggo\n- Everyone knows who gets the special route based on formation rules\n\nThink of \"Smash\" as the base play, and \"Sluggo\" as the wrinkle that makes one route different - keeping the defense honest when they think they know what's coming!\n\n\n\n\n\n## China Concept\n\n**\"China\"** is a 3-level vertical stretch concept that attacks the deep, intermediate, and short zones on one side of the field.\n\n## The Basic China Route Combo\n\n**Three Routes (from outside in):**\n\n1. **#1 (Outside)**: Corner or Deep Out\n2. **#2 (Middle)**: Deep Dig/Over (18-20 yards)\n3. **#3 (Inside)**: Shallow/Underneath (5-6 yards)\n\nThis creates a **diagonal stretch** down the field.\n\n## Why It's Called \"China\"\n\nDifferent theories:\n\n- Some say it resembles the shape of China on a map\n- Others say it's just a random code name\n- Every team has different origins for their concept names\n\n## How China Works\n\n**The Read (High to Low):**\n\n1. **Deep**: Corner route stretches the safety\n2. **Intermediate**: Dig/Over in the void (money throw)\n3. **Underneath**: Shallow for hot/checkdown\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n- Forces defenders to cover all three levels\n- Linebacker can't cover both shallow and dig\n- Safety can't cover both corner and dig\n\n## Variations\n\n**\"China Bow\"**\n\n- Add a post route from backside\n\n**\"China Drive\"**\n\n- \\#2 runs a shallower dig (12-15 yards)\n\n**\"China Flood\"**\n\n- RB releases to flat for 4th option\n\n## When to Use China\n\n**Great against:**\n\n- Cover 3 (attacks the levels)\n- Cover 2 (dig splits the safeties)\n- Works from any 3×1 or trips formation\n\n**The Key:** China is all about that **intermediate dig route** - it's usually the primary target, with the corner holding the safety and the shallow as the outlet. It's a rhythm passing concept where the QB knows exactly where each route will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "02b-concepts-intermd_deep.md": "Excellent! Now I see the full picture - this is a sophisticated **\"Dagger Concept\"** variant with a delay element!\n\n## The True Route Concept\n\n**What you're describing:**\n- **Z**: Deep over/dig - crosses entire field 18-22 yards deep (ends between hash and numbers right)\n- **X**: \"Flag Post\" or \"Bender\" - vertical stem reading the safety\n- **U**: Block → delay to flat\n\n## This is \"DAGGER DELAY\"\n\n**Classic Dagger Concept:**\n- **\"Dig\"** (deep in) from one side (your Z)\n- **\"Vertical/Seam\"** from the other (your X)\n- Creates a high-low on the middle safety\n\n## The X Route Read\n\n**\"Flag Post\" or \"Bender\" Route:**\n- X stems vertical first\n- **Reads the free safety:**\n  - Safety stays middle → break to corner/flag\n  - Safety jumps the dig → break to post\n- This is called a \"single high beater\"\n\n## Why This Works\n\n**The Triangle Stretch:**\n1. **Deep**: X's vertical/bender holds safety\n2. **Intermediate**: Z's deep over (18-22 yards)\n3. **Underneath**: U's delay to flat\n\n**Safety in Conflict:**\n- Can't cover both the deep over AND the bender\n- If he jumps the dig, X is open on post\n- If he stays deep, Z is open on the dig\n\n## The Play Call\n\n**\"12 Gun Sidecar, Dagger Delay\"**\n\nOr more detailed:\n**\"12 Gun, Z-Over, X-Bender, U-Delay\"**\n\nThis is a pro-level concept - that 18-22 yard deep cross is the money throw, but having X read the safety makes it nearly impossible to defend with single-high safety. The U delay keeps the underneath defender honest too!\n\n\n",
  "02c-madden_concepts.md": "Yes, exactly! **\"Mtn\"** in Madden is short for **\"Motion\"** - it's telling you there will be pre-snap motion in the play.\n\n## How Madden Uses Motion Tags\n\n**\"Mtn China Cross\"** means:\n- There WILL be pre-snap motion\n- Usually it's predetermined who motions (often the slot or Z receiver)\n- The motion happens automatically when you snap it\n\n## Real NFL Motion Terminology\n\nNFL teams get more specific with motion calls:\n\n**Types of Motion:**\n- **\"Zip\"** = Z receiver in motion\n- **\"Jet\"** = Fast motion across formation  \n- **\"Orbit\"** = RB motion from backfield\n- **\"Return\"** = Motion one way, then back\n- **\"Shift\"** = Multiple players reset\n\n**Example NFL Calls:**\n- **\"Zip Motion China\"** = Z motions, then run China concept\n- **\"Jet Sweep Fake\"** = Fast motion with fake handoff\n- **\"Orbit to Trips\"** = RB motions to create trips\n\n## Why Motion Matters\n\n**Information Gathering:**\n- See if defense follows (man coverage)\n- Defense stays (zone coverage)\n\n**Creating Advantages:**\n- Get better leverage\n- Create mismatches\n- Change formation strength\n\nSo yes, when you see **\"Mtn\"** in Madden, it's literally abbreviating \"Motion\" - the game is telling you someone will move before the snap. In the actual NFL, they'd specify exactly WHO motions and HOW (Zip, Jet, Orbit, etc.), but Madden simplifies it to just \"Mtn\" to keep the play names manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at your list, here are the plays that likely have similar or identical route concepts:\n\n## Identical Route Concepts (Different Formations)\n\n### **Passing Concepts That Repeat**\n\n- **Flood** → **PA Flood** (same routes, one with play action)\n- **Verticals** (appears 3 times - same 4 verts concept)\n- **Stick** (appears twice - same concept)\n- **Cross Drag** → **PA Cross** → **PA Deep Cross Go** (all have crossing routes)\n\n### **Boot Action Route Combos**\n\nThese likely have very similar routes:\n\n- **PA Boot**\n- **PA Boot Lt Flat**\n- **PA Boot Corner Post**\n- **PA Boot Slide**\n\nAll probably have: Drag, Deep Over/Cross, and a Flat/RB route - just with slight variations.\n\n### **Dagger Family**\n\n- **Sft Mtn PA Dagger Cross**\n- **PA Deep Cross Go**\n- **PA X Out Cross**\n- **PA Post Dig**\n\nThese all feature deep crossing/dig routes with a vertical element.\n\n### **Curl/Hitch Concepts**\n\n- **PA Curls**\n- **PA Post Curl Slot**\n- **Cheat Deep Hitch Over**\n\nAll have curl/hitch routes at intermediate levels.\n\n### **Deep Shot Plays**\n\n- **PA Deep Out**\n- **Corner Double In**\n- **PA Post Dig**\n- **PA Post Curl Slot**\n\nThese are your deeper developing concepts.\n\n## Route Concepts by Type\n\n**Horizontal Stretches:**\n\n- Spacing\n- Stick\n- Flood\n- Cross Drag\n\n**Vertical Stretches:**\n\n- Verticals\n- Dagger variations\n- Post combinations\n\n**Option Routes:**\n\n- Spot Y Option\n- WR Option\n\nThe key insight: You're running maybe **8-10 core route concepts** but dressing them up with different formations, motions, and play action to make them look like 40+ different plays to the defense!\n\n\n\n",
  "03-timing.md": "\n10 yards out when the receiver has been running you can then throw the deep ball after he is 10 yards out\n\nand deeper than that from the hash can drive the ball to the left about 10 yard back and 10 yards to the left to let the receiver run.\n\n\n",
  "04-motions.md": "You're right to highlight that - let me clarify the \"continuing motion\" exception:\n\n## Two Types of Motion\n\n### 1. **Reset Motion**\n- RB motions from right to left\n- **STOPS** and gets set in new position\n- Must be set for 1 full second before snap\n- Now he's just in a different alignment\n\n### 2. **Motion at the Snap** (Continuing Motion)\n- RB starts motion from right to left\n- **KEEPS MOVING** through the snap\n- Never stops or gets set\n- Ball can be snapped while he's still in motion\n\n## The Key Rule\n\n**Only ONE player** can be in motion at the snap, and he must be:\n- Moving **parallel** to the line of scrimmage, OR\n- Moving **backward** (away from the line)\n- **NOT** moving forward toward the line\n\n## Common Examples of Continuing Motion\n\n- **Jet sweep**: WR in fast motion across formation at the snap\n- **Fly sweep**: RB in motion takes handoff while running full speed\n- **Motion to create trips**: Slot receiver motioning out wide as ball is snapped\n\nThis is why you'll sometimes see:\n- QB doing a hard count while the RB is still motioning, timing the snap perfectly\n- The RB suddenly accelerating during his motion - this is often the \"jet\" action for a sweep or fake\n\nThe advantage of continuing motion is that the defense has less time to adjust since the player never stops, and it can create immediate horizontal momentum for certain plays.\n",
  "05-dummy_counts.md": "Great question about snap counts! This is the verbal cadence system QBs use to initiate the play.\n\n## Basic Snap Count Structure\n\n**Common sequence**:\n- \"Set\" - Alerts everyone to get in their stance\n- \"Hut\" - The trigger word (can be on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)\n\nExample: \"Set... hut-HUT!\" (snap on second hut)\n\n## How Snap Counts Work\n\n**\"On one\"**: Snap on the first \"hut\"\n- \"Set, HUT!\" - ball snapped immediately\n\n**\"On two\"**: Snap on the second \"hut\"  \n- \"Set, hut-HUT!\" - ball snapped on second one\n\n**\"On three\"**: You get the idea\n- \"Set, hut-hut-HUT!\"\n\n## Why Vary the Count?\n\n**Offensive advantages**:\n- Keep defense from timing the snap\n- Try to draw them offside (hard count)\n- Control tempo and rhythm\n- Give time for motion or adjustments\n\n**Hard Count**:\n- QB emphasizes certain \"huts\" without it being the snap\n- \"Set... HUT!... hut-HUT!\" (snap on third, but first one was loud)\n- Trying to make defense jump early\n\n## Other Common Cadences\n\nDifferent QBs/teams use variations:\n- \"Blue 42, Blue 42, Set, Hut!\"\n- \"Green 18, Green 18, Hut-Hut!\"\n- \"Ready... Set... Go!\"\n- Silent count (in loud stadiums) - based on leg lift or head bob\n\nThe colored numbers (Blue 42, etc.) are often dummy calls or audibles, but can also indicate the snap count to the offense in coded ways.\n\n**Key**: Only the offense knows the real count, giving them a split-second advantage at the snap.\n\nExcellent breakdown of a complex hard count system! You're showing how QBs layer multiple elements to manipulate the defense.\n\n## Your Hard Count System Decoded\n\n**The Setup**:\n- **\"Daytona\"** = Dummy call (means nothing, just selling the fake)\n- **Color calls** = Actual snap count indicators:\n  - \"Red\" = snap on 1\n  - \"White\" = snap on 2  \n  - \"Blue\" = snap on 3\n- **\"Blue 42, Blue 42\"** = More dummy verbiage for deception\n\n## How This Sequence Works\n\n1. **\"Daytona\"** - Defense thinks something important, but it's meaningless\n2. **\"Blue 42, Blue 42\"** - More noise, building tension\n3. **\"Red\"** - Real indicator (snap on 1) but defense doesn't know this\n4. **\"Set\"** - Everyone gets ready\n5. **\"HUT-hut-hut\"** - But only the first HUT matters (on one)\n\n## The Psychology\n\n**Why it works**:\n- Defense hears all this verbiage and gets anxious\n- The multiple \"huts\" after knowing it's \"on one\" are bait\n- Defense might jump on the emphasized second or third \"hut\"\n- Your offense knows to ignore everything except that \"Red\" call\n\n## Advanced Wrinkles\n\nTeams often add:\n- **Voice inflection changes** - Yelling certain dummy words\n- **Rhythm changes** - Speed up/slow down between words\n- **Body language** - QB lifts leg or moves hands on dummy counts\n- **\"Kill\" calls** - Can change the snap count after initial call\n\nThis is exactly the type of system teams like the Packers use with Aaron Rodgers' famous hard counts - lots of noise and deception, but the offense has one simple key (\"Red\" in your example) that tells them the real count.\n",
  "06-against_blitz.md": "Exactly! You're thinking like a QB now - the hot route is critical for beating the blitz.\n\n## Hot Routes vs Blitz\n\n**The \"Sit\" as a Hot Route**:\n- RB sits right behind/between the blitzing linebackers\n- Usually 4-6 yards deep in the vacated space\n- QB knows EXACTLY where he'll be pre-snap\n- Ball comes out in 1.5-2 seconds\n\n## How Hot Routes Work\n\n**Pre-snap read**:\n- QB identifies potential blitzers\n- Knows RB is hot if they come\n- On snap: If blitz comes, immediate throw to the sit\n\n**\"Sight Adjust\" concept**:\n- RB sees blitz → converts to hot\n- Could change from wheel to sit automatically\n- Both QB and RB see the same thing\n\n## Full Hot Route System\n\n**\"Trey Left Flood, Fly Left Sit, HOT\"**\n\nThis means:\n- **Primary**: Flood concept to the trey\n- **RB**: Sits in space\n- **HOT**: Pre-designated quick throw vs pressure\n\nCould also call:\n- **\"Z Hot Slant\"** - Slot receiver hot\n- **\"Y Hot Seam\"** - TE splits defenders\n- **\"X Hot Hitch\"** - Backside quick throw\n\n## Where to Sit\n\n**Behind/Between defenders**:\n- Find the \"window\" where blitzers came from\n- Usually inside the numbers\n- Not too deep (keep it quick)\n- Face QB immediately after sitting\n\n## Protection Adjustment\n\n**\"Hot\" protection**:\n- Line knows it's quick throw\n- \"Big on Big\" (linemen block linebackers)\n- RB is outlet, not blocker\n- Get 5 vertical sets to buy time\n\nThe beauty is the defense shows blitz to disrupt you, but you WANT them to blitz because the hot throw is often wide open for 6-8 yards where the linebacker vacated.\n",

TE pulling = maximum run sell\n2. Outside WR can sell stalk block\n3. Then slips on the slant\n4. Defense is completely flowing away\n\nThanks for the clarification - TE as the razor makes way more sense than a WR for selling the run fake!\n\n## Personnel Groupings Breakdown\n\n**The Two-Digit System:**\n\n**First Digit = Running Backs** (RB + FB counted together)\n**Second Digit = Tight Ends**\n\n## Examples:\n\n**21 Personnel**\n- **2** = Running backs (could be 1 RB + 1 FB)\n- **1** = Tight end\n- By default: 2 WRs (since 2+1+2 = 5 skill players)\n\n**11 Personnel** (Most common in modern NFL)\n- **1** = Running back\n- **1** = Tight end  \n- By default: 3 WRs\n\n**12 Personnel**\n- **1** = Running back\n- **2** = Tight ends\n- By default: 2 WRs\n\n**00 Personnel** (Empty)\n- **0** = No running backs\n- **0** = No tight ends\n- By default: 5 WRs\n\n## The Math\n\n**Always adds up to 5 skill position players:**\n- (RBs) + (TEs) + (WRs) = 5\n- WRs aren't stated, they're whatever is left over\n\n## Your Formation\n\n**\"21 Personnel, Tight Twins Left, I-Right\"**\n- 2 backs (FB + RB in I-formation)\n- 1 tight end (aligned as slot in twins)\n- 2 wide receivers (one outside left, one split right)\n\nThe beauty of personnel groupings is the defense must match with their own personnel - see \"21\" and they'll likely stay in base defense, then you motion to spread them out!\n\n\n\n",
  "08-plays.md": "Perfect addition! Now you're creating a full flood concept with the FB releasing to the flat after the counter fake.\n\n## The FB Route Addition\n\n**FB to Flat After Counter Fake**:\n1. **Initial**: FB leads right like blocking for counter\n2. **Sells fake**: Takes 2-3 hard steps like lead blocker\n3. **Release**: Slips out to right flat\n4. **Result**: Late developing outlet option\n\n## Why This Is Brilliant\n\n**The Deception Layers**:\n- TE razors across (sell #1)\n- Counter action fake (sell #2)  \n- FB leads like blocking (sell #3)\n- Then FB releases when LBs are completely fooled\n\n**Creates a Full Concept**:\n- **Slip-2** (slant) = Middle of field\n- **Cross-7** = Deep/intermediate\n- **FB Flat** = Underneath outlet\n- You're attacking all levels\n\n## The Updated Call\n\n**\"21 Counter Razor, TE Pull, Slip-2, FB Leak\"**\n\nOr more detailed:\n**\"21 Personnel, Tight Twins Left, I-Right, TE Razor, Counter Action, Slip-2, Cross-7, FB Flat\"**\n\n## The Read Progression\n\n**QB's likely reads**:\n1. **Pre-snap**: Check for blitz (FB might be hot)\n2. **Primary**: Slip slant (if LBs flow)\n3. **Secondary**: Cross-7 breaking to corner\n4. **Outlet**: FB in flat (always open late)\n\n## Why FB Flat Works\n\n**The Conflict**:\n- Edge defender sees counter fake\n- Crashes down on \"run\"\n- FB releases behind him\n- Nobody left to cover flat\n\nThis is exactly the type of play design where every fake builds on the previous one. The FB flat probably gets 6-8 easy yards if everything else is covered because the defense has completely committed to stopping the fake counter.\n",
