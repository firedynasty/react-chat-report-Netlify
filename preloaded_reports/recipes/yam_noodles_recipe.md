Ah perfect! For a cashew sauce for your yam noodles:

**Basic ratio:**

- 2-3 tablespoons cashew butter
- 2-3 tablespoons warm water (to thin)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 small clove garlic, minced or grated
- Optional: 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup or honey to balance

**Method:** Mix the cashew butter with warm water first to get it smooth and pourable - adjust water amount based on how thick your cashew butter is. Then whisk in the other ingredients. The sauce should coat a spoon but still be fluid.

**Flavor tweaks you might like:**

- Add grated ginger for brightness
- Chili flakes or chili oil if you want heat
- Squeeze of lime juice instead of rice vinegar for tang

Toss with your warm yam noodles. The starch from the noodles will help the sauce cling nicely.

Since you're working with shirataki/konjac yam noodles (very low calorie), this cashew sauce adds good healthy fats and flavor without seed oils. The cashew butter gives you that creamy, rich mouthfeel similar to peanut sauce but with the nutrition profile you prefer.
