# bone broth

Here's how to make bone broth in an Instant Pot:

Ingredients:

- 2-3 pounds of bones (chicken, beef, or pork)

- 1 onion, quartered

- 2 carrots, roughly chopped

- 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped

- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

- 1 bay leaf

- Optional: garlic, ginger, peppercorns

- Water to cover (but don't exceed max fill line)

Instructions:

1. If using raw bones, you can brown them first using the Sauté function, or roast in oven at 400°F for better flavor, roast for 30-45 minutes

2. Put bones and all ingredients in the Instant Pot

  - For chicken bones: cook on HIGH pressure for 2-3 hours

  - For beef/pork bones: cook on HIGH pressure for 3-4 hours

3. Let pressure release naturally (about 30 minutes)

4. Strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth

5. Once cooled, you can remove the fat layer from the top if desired

Tips:

- Don't fill past the max line - bones and water expand during cooking

- You can reuse the same bones 2-3 times (just add fresh vegetables each time)

- Store in fridge up to 5 days or freeze up to 6 months

- For maximum nutrition, add any vegetable scraps you've saved

**cold veggie smoothie**

**Cooked Broccoli Smoothie Recipe**

**Ingredients:**

• **1 cup cooked, cold broccoli** (steamed or boiled, then cooled)

• **1 ripe banana** (adds natural sweetness)

• **1/2 cup plain or vanilla yogurt** (for creaminess and a slight tang)

• **1/2 cup cold water or milk** (adjust for desired thickness)

• **Ice cubes** (4–5, or as needed)

Ice cubes in a smoothie serve a few purposes:

**1. Cooling the Smoothie**

• Ice chills the smoothie, making it refreshing and enjoyable, especially on warm days.

• If you’re using fresh (non-frozen) ingredients, ice is essential for that cold, slushy texture.

**2. Adding Thickness**

• Blending ice cubes creates a thicker, frothy texture. It gives the smoothie more body without needing extra ingredients like frozen fruit or yogurt.

• Perfect for those who prefer their smoothies more milkshake-like.

**3. Diluting Intense Flavors**

• Ice slightly dilutes strong or earthy flavors (like broccoli or kale), balancing the taste.

• This is helpful if you’re experimenting with veggies in your smoothie and want to tone down their intensity.

**Alternatives to Ice Cubes**

If you don’t want to use ice, try:

1. **Frozen Broccoli**: Use frozen, cooked broccoli instead of fresh.

2. **Frozen Banana**: Slice and freeze the banana beforehand for a creamy, cold smoothie.

3. **Frozen Yogurt Cubes**: Freeze portions of yogurt in an ice tray for added creaminess.

Adding ice cubes is optional, but they can transform the texture and temperature, making the smoothie more refreshing and palatable! 😊

**Kimchi**

		1 medium head napa cabbage (about 2 pounds)

		1/4 cup iodine-free sea salt or kosher salt (see Recipe Notes)

		Water, preferably distilled or filtered

		1 tablespoon grated garlic (5 to 6 cloves)

		1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger

		1 teaspoon granulated sugar

		2 tablepoons fish sauce or salted shrimp paste, or 3 tablespoons water

		1 to 5 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes ()

		8 ounces Korean radish or daikon radish, peeled and cut into matchsticks

		4 medium scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

Main thing is to salt, then add water, then wait, then rinse, then make the sauce, 

I'll help you create traditional kimchi (kimchi-guk). Here's a detailed recipe:

For the vegetables:

1 large Napa cabbage (about 3-4 pounds), cut into 2-inch pieces

1/4 cup sea salt

2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)

4 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon grated ginger

2 tablespoons fish sauce

2 tablespoons salted shrimp (saeujeot), minced (optional)

1 Asian pear, grated

4 green onions, chopped

1/4 cup white onion, minced

2 tablespoons sugar

1 medium daikon radish, julienned

Instructions:

1. Salt the cabbage: Place cabbage in a large bowl, sprinkle with salt. Mix well and let sit for 2 hours. Rinse thoroughly and drain.

2. Make the paste: In a bowl, combine gochugaru, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, salted shrimp (if using), Asian pear, sugar, and onions.

3. Combine: Mix the drained cabbage with the paste, making sure each piece is well-coated.

 Add the julienned radish and green onions later.

4. Ferment: Pack the mixture into clean jars, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top (it will expand during fermentation). Let sit at room temperature for 1-5 days, depending on your preference. Taste daily - when it reaches your desired level of sourness, refrigerate.

Use fermented weights, and saukercraut pounder to get it down.

Storage: Kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the refrigerator and can last for several months, developing a more complex, tangy flavor over time.

Tips:

- Use clean utensils when handling to prevent unwanted bacteria

- Press down the kimchi to keep it submerged in its liquid

- Open the jar occasionally to release built-up gases

- For vegetarian kimchi, omit the fish sauce and salted shrimp, replacing with soy sauce or miso paste

- The fermentation will be faster in warm weather and slower in cold

**hummus**

Here are some great pairings with hummus that would work similarly to how tofu and pine nuts add protein and crunch:

**pasta dough**

Recipe for hand-torn pasta dough (mian pian/수제비):

Ingredients:

- 2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1/2 cup warm water

- 1/2 tsp salt

Instructions:

1. Mix flour and salt

2. Gradually add warm water while mixing until it forms a shaggy dough

3. Knead 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic

4. Rest dough 30 minutes, covered

5. Roll dough to 1/8 inch thickness

6. Tear or cut small irregular pieces (roughly 1-inch)

7. Cook in boiling water 2-3 minutes until they float

Tips:

- Dough should be firm but pliable

- Can add egg for richer dough

- Flour hands when tearing to prevent sticking

- Drop tears directly into boiling water or dust with flour if making ahead

Kneading develops gluten protein networks in dough by:

- Aligning and connecting wheat proteins (glutenin and gliadin)

- Creating elasticity and structure

- Building dough strength for better texture

- Trapping air bubbles for proper rise

This protein network gives pasta its characteristic chewy texture and helps it hold together during cooking.

Cook the torn pieces in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until they float to the surface. Add them one at a time to prevent sticking.

For a flatbread-style dough:

- Temperature: 425°F (220°C), 400 degrees convection,

- Time: 12-15 minutes until golden brown , 15 minutes is good

- Roll to about 1/4 inch thickness

- Optional: Score surface lightly before baking

**protein**

Protein is an essential macronutrient necessary for the repair, maintenance, and growth of tissues in the body. It's important for everyone to include good sources of protein in their diet. Here’s a list of excellent protein sources, categorized by animal-based and plant-based:

**Animal-Based Protein Sources**

**Meat:** Beef, pork, lamb, and other red meats are high in protein but should be consumed in moderation due to their saturated fat content.

**Poultry:** Chicken and turkey are excellent sources of lean protein and are widely used in various cuisines.

**Fish and Seafood:** Salmon, tuna, mackerel, and sardines are not only rich in protein but also provide healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Shellfish like shrimp and crab are also high in protein.

**Eggs:** Often referred to as a "complete protein," eggs contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.

**Dairy Products:** Milk, cheese, yogurt, and whey protein are good sources of protein and contain valuable calcium for bone health.

**Plant-Based Protein Sources**

**Legumes:** Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas are high in protein and fiber, which makes them very filling.

**Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, and flaxseeds are not only rich in protein but also contain healthy fats and fiber.

**Soy Products:** Tofu, tempeh, and edamame are excellent sources of protein and versatile enough to be used in a variety of dishes.

**Whole Grains:** Quinoa, brown rice, barley, and whole-wheat products can contribute a significant amount of protein to your diet.

**Seitan:** Also known as wheat meat, seitan is made from gluten and is high in protein, making it a popular protein source for vegetarians and vegans.

**Additional Considerations**

**Protein Powders:** These can be derived from whey, casein, soy, pea, or hemp and are useful for people looking to increase their protein intake conveniently.

**Insects:** In some cultures, insects like crickets are consumed as a sustainable and high-protein food source.

A balanced diet that includes a variety of these foods can ensure adequate intake of all essential amino acids and other nutrients. When planning meals, it's beneficial to consider both the quantity and quality of the protein sources, especially for vegetarians and vegans, to ensure a complete amino acid profile.

**Sandwich - advocado**

Simple lunch

A great lunch you can make with two slices of bread is a grilled cheese sandwich with avocado and tomato. Here's how you can prepare it:

Ingredients:

2 slices of your favorite bread (sourdough, whole wheat, or white bread work well)

1/2 ripe avocado

1 medium tomato, sliced

2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or Swiss)

1 tablespoon of butter

Salt and pepper to taste

Optional: a few fresh basil leaves for added flavor

Instructions:

Prepare the Avocado and Tomato:

Slice the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the avocado out of the skin. Mash it lightly with a fork, adding a pinch of salt and pepper.

Slice the tomato into thin rounds.

Assemble the Sandwich:

Spread the mashed avocado evenly on one slice of bread.

Layer the tomato slices on top of the avocado.

Add the cheese slices on top of the tomato. If you're using basil, add a few leaves here as well.

Top with the second slice of bread.

Grill the Sandwich:

Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add half of the butter to the skillet and let it melt.

Place the sandwich in the skillet. Cook until the bread is golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.

Add the remaining butter to the skillet, flip the sandwich, and cook the other side until golden brown and the cheese is melted.

Serve:

Remove the sandwich from the skillet, slice it in half, and enjoy your delicious, warm, and comforting grilled cheese with avocado and tomato!

That's a great idea! You can pan fry the cheese to get that perfect melt while using your existing toast. Here's how:

Heat your pan over medium heat

Place the cheese slices directly in the pan - they'll start to melt and get a bit crispy on the bottom

Once the cheese starts bubbling and getting golden on the edges (about 1-2 minutes), carefully slide a spatula underneath

Transfer the melted cheese directly onto your toast, then add your avocado and tomato

This method will actually give you a nice crispy cheese crust on the bottom, which adds an extra dimension of texture to your sandwich. Just keep a close eye on it since cheese can go from perfectly melted to burnt pretty quickly!

However, don’t need to add oil when pan frying cheese because already has oils else will become greasy.

The idea that "carbs feed the disease in diabetes" stems from the fact that carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which can impact blood sugar levels. This concept is particularly relevant for individuals with diabetes, where managing blood sugar levels is crucial. Here's a deeper dive into the relationship between carbohydrates and diabetes:

### How Carbohydrates Affect Diabetes

1. **Carbohydrate Metabolism:**

   - **Glucose Production:** When you consume carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. This process raises blood sugar levels.

   - **Insulin Response:** Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream to use for energy or store for later use. In diabetes, insulin production is either impaired (Type 1) or cells become resistant to insulin's effects (Type 2).

2. **Types of Carbohydrates:**

   - **Simple Carbs:** Found in sugars and processed foods, simple carbs are quickly absorbed, leading to rapid spikes in blood sugar.

   - **Complex Carbs:** Found in whole grains, vegetables, and legumes, these carbs are digested more slowly, causing a gradual increase in blood sugar levels.

3. **Glycemic Index (GI):**

   - Foods are often categorized by their glycemic index, which measures how quickly carbohydrates in a food raise blood sugar levels. High-GI foods cause quick spikes, while low-GI foods result in a slower, more gradual increase.

### Managing Carbohydrate Intake in Diabetes

1. **Monitoring Carbohydrate Intake:**

   - **Carb Counting:** Many individuals with diabetes use carb counting to manage their blood sugar levels. This involves tracking the number of carbohydrates consumed at each meal and adjusting insulin doses accordingly.

   - **Portion Control:** Understanding portion sizes can help maintain blood sugar levels within the target range.

2. **Choosing Low-Glycemic Foods:**

   - Emphasizing low-GI foods can lead to more stable blood sugar levels. Examples include whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables.

3. **Balancing Macronutrients:**

   - A balanced diet with appropriate amounts of protein and healthy fats can slow carbohydrate absorption, providing more stable blood sugar levels.

### Myths and Misunderstandings

1. **"All Carbs Are Bad":**

   - Not all carbohydrates negatively impact blood sugar. Whole foods with fiber, vitamins, and minerals can be part of a healthy diet.

2. **Complete Elimination of Carbs:**

   - While reducing carb intake can help some individuals manage their diabetes, complete elimination isn't necessary or advisable. Carbs are essential for energy and various bodily functions.

3. **Individualized Approaches:**

   - Each person's diabetes management plan should be tailored to their specific needs, preferences, and medical advice.

### The Role of Diet in Diabetes Management

1. **Low-Carb Diets:**

   - Some studies suggest that low-carb diets can improve blood sugar control and reduce reliance on medication for some individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

2. **Mediterranean and DASH Diets:**

   - Diets like the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which focus on whole foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats, have shown positive effects on blood sugar management.

3. **Medical Supervision:**

   - It's essential for individuals with diabetes to work with healthcare professionals, such as dietitians and endocrinologists, to create a sustainable and effective dietary plan.

### Conclusion

While carbohydrates do play a role in raising blood sugar levels, the key to managing diabetes is understanding how different types of carbs affect the body and finding a balanced, individualized approach to diet. Making informed food choices, monitoring intake, and working closely with healthcare providers can help manage diabetes effectively.
