I'll guide you through sprouting broccoli seeds in a mason jar. It's a simple process that takes about 4-5 days.

Make sure to use filtered water

You'll need:

- A wide-mouth mason jar

- Sprouting lid or cheesecloth with rubber band

- Broccoli seeds (**2-3 tablespoons)**

- Clean water

Steps:

1. Initial Setup (Day 1):

   - Rinse your broccoli seeds

   - Put them in the mason jar

   - Fill jar 1/4 with cool water

   - Cover with sprouting lid or cheesecloth

   - Let seeds soak for 8 hours or overnight

2. First Rinse (After soaking):

   - Drain water completely

   - Rinse seeds with fresh water

   - Drain thoroughly

   - Place jar at an angle (45°) in a bowl, lid side down for drainage

3. Daily Process (Days 2-5):

   - Rinse and drain 2-3 times per day

   - Always keep jar at an angle for drainage

   - Keep out of direct sunlight

   - Maintain room temperature (65-75°F)

4. Final Steps (Day 4-5):

   - Once sprouts are about 1-2 inches long

   - Give them a final rinse

   - Remove any unsprouted seeds

   - Store in refrigerator

Tips:

- If you see any mold, discard the batch
