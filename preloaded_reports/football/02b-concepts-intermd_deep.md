Excellent! Now I see the full picture - this is a sophisticated **"Dagger Concept"** variant with a delay element!

## The True Route Concept

**What you're describing:**
- **Z**: Deep over/dig - crosses entire field 18-22 yards deep (ends between hash and numbers right)
- **X**: "Flag Post" or "Bender" - vertical stem reading the safety
- **U**: Block → delay to flat

## This is "DAGGER DELAY"

**Classic Dagger Concept:**
- **"Dig"** (deep in) from one side (your Z)
- **"Vertical/Seam"** from the other (your X)
- Creates a high-low on the middle safety

## The X Route Read

**"Flag Post" or "Bender" Route:**
- X stems vertical first
- **Reads the free safety:**
  - Safety stays middle → break to corner/flag
  - Safety jumps the dig → break to post
- This is called a "single high beater"

## Why This Works

**The Triangle Stretch:**
1. **Deep**: X's vertical/bender holds safety
2. **Intermediate**: Z's deep over (18-22 yards)
3. **Underneath**: U's delay to flat

**Safety in Conflict:**
- Can't cover both the deep over AND the bender
- If he jumps the dig, X is open on post
- If he stays deep, Z is open on the dig

## The Play Call

**"12 Gun Sidecar, Dagger Delay"**

Or more detailed:
**"12 Gun, Z-Over, X-Bender, U-Delay"**

This is a pro-level concept - that 18-22 yard deep cross is the money throw, but having X read the safety makes it nearly impossible to defend with single-high safety. The U delay keeps the underneath defender honest too!
