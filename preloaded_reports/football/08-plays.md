Perfect addition! Now you're creating a full flood concept with the FB releasing to the flat after the counter fake.

## The FB Route Addition

**FB to Flat After Counter Fake**:
1. **Initial**: FB leads right like blocking for counter
2. **Sells fake**: Takes 2-3 hard steps like lead blocker
3. **Release**: Slips out to right flat
4. **Result**: Late developing outlet option

## Why This Is Brilliant

**The Deception Layers**:
- TE razors across (sell #1)
- Counter action fake (sell #2)  
- FB leads like blocking (sell #3)
- Then FB releases when LBs are completely fooled

**Creates a Full Concept**:
- **Slip-2** (slant) = Middle of field
- **Cross-7** = Deep/intermediate
- **FB Flat** = Underneath outlet
- You're attacking all levels

## The Updated Call

**"21 Counter Razor, TE Pull, Slip-2, FB Leak"**

Or more detailed:
**"21 Personnel, Tight Twins Left, I-Right, TE Razor, Counter Action, Slip-2, Cross-7, FB Flat"**

## The Read Progression

**QB's likely reads**:
1. **Pre-snap**: Check for blitz (FB might be hot)
2. **Primary**: Slip slant (if LBs flow)
3. **Secondary**: Cross-7 breaking to corner
4. **Outlet**: FB in flat (always open late)

## Why FB Flat Works

**The Conflict**:
- Edge defender sees counter fake
- Crashes down on "run"
- FB releases behind him
- Nobody left to cover flat

This is exactly the type of play design where every fake builds on the previous one. The FB flat probably gets 6-8 easy yards if everything else is covered because the defense has completely committed to stopping the fake counter.
