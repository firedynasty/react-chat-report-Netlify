You’re looking for all-22 film (also called coach’s film) which shows
the full field and all players, rather than the typical broadcast angles
that follow the ball. Here are the best places to find this:

Free Options: - NFL Game Pass - Offers free access to condensed games
and some all-22 footage, though full features require subscription -
YouTube channels like QB School (as you mentioned), Brett Kollmann, and
other film study channels that use all-22 footage in breakdowns -
College football - Some games are broadcast with wider “sky cam” angles
that show more of the field

Paid Options: - NFL Game Pass (full subscription) - The gold standard
with complete all-22 film for every NFL game, multiple camera angles,
and coaching film going back years - ESPN+ and SEC Network+ - Some
college games include all-22 or wider angle coverage - Team-specific
subscriptions - Some college programs offer their own film access

For Analysis: - Pro Football Focus (PFF) - Subscription service with
detailed film breakdowns - The Athletic and other sports sites often
embed all-22 clips in their analysis pieces

The challenge is that broadcast networks typically don’t show all-22
during live games because casual viewers prefer following the action,
but NFL Game Pass is really your best bet for comprehensive access to
the coaching film perspective you’re after.
