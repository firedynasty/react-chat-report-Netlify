Yes, exactly! **"Mtn"** in Madden is short for **"Motion"** - it's telling you there will be pre-snap motion in the play.

## How Madden Uses Motion Tags

**"Mtn China Cross"** means:
- There WILL be pre-snap motion
- Usually it's predetermined who motions (often the slot or Z receiver)
- The motion happens automatically when you snap it

## Real NFL Motion Terminology

NFL teams get more specific with motion calls:

**Types of Motion:**
- **"Zip"** = Z receiver in motion
- **"Jet"** = Fast motion across formation  
- **"Orbit"** = RB motion from backfield
- **"Return"** = Motion one way, then back
- **"Shift"** = Multiple players reset

**Example NFL Calls:**
- **"Zip Motion China"** = Z motions, then run China concept
- **"Jet Sweep Fake"** = Fast motion with fake handoff
- **"Orbit to Trips"** = RB motions to create trips

## Why Motion Matters

**Information Gathering:**
- See if defense follows (man coverage)
- Defense stays (zone coverage)

**Creating Advantages:**
- Get better leverage
- Create mismatches
- Change formation strength

So yes, when you see **"Mtn"** in Madden, it's literally abbreviating "Motion" - the game is telling you someone will move before the snap. In the actual NFL, they'd specify exactly WHO motions and HOW (Zip, Jet, Orbit, etc.), but Madden simplifies it to just "Mtn" to keep the play names manageable.





Looking at your list, here are the plays that likely have similar or identical route concepts:

## Identical Route Concepts (Different Formations)

### **Passing Concepts That Repeat**

- **Flood** → **PA Flood** (same routes, one with play action)
- **Verticals** (appears 3 times - same 4 verts concept)
- **Stick** (appears twice - same concept)
- **Cross Drag** → **PA Cross** → **PA Deep Cross Go** (all have crossing routes)

### **Boot Action Route Combos**

These likely have very similar routes:

- **PA Boot**
- **PA Boot Lt Flat**
- **PA Boot Corner Post**
- **PA Boot Slide**

All probably have: Drag, Deep Over/Cross, and a Flat/RB route - just with slight variations.

### **Dagger Family**

- **Sft Mtn PA Dagger Cross**
- **PA Deep Cross Go**
- **PA X Out Cross**
- **PA Post Dig**

These all feature deep crossing/dig routes with a vertical element.

### **Curl/Hitch Concepts**

- **PA Curls**
- **PA Post Curl Slot**
- **Cheat Deep Hitch Over**

All have curl/hitch routes at intermediate levels.

### **Deep Shot Plays**

- **PA Deep Out**
- **Corner Double In**
- **PA Post Dig**
- **PA Post Curl Slot**

These are your deeper developing concepts.

## Route Concepts by Type

**Horizontal Stretches:**

- Spacing
- Stick
- Flood
- Cross Drag

**Vertical Stretches:**

- Verticals
- Dagger variations
- Post combinations

**Option Routes:**

- Spot Y Option
- WR Option

The key insight: You're running maybe **8-10 core route concepts** but dressing them up with different formations, motions, and play action to make them look like 40+ different plays to the defense!
