Ah, I see the confusion now! You're right - let me correct this:

## The Actual Personnel/Formation

**It's NOT "36" personnel** - that was my mistake. Looking at your formation:

**What you actually have**:
- **Tight Twins Left** = WR + TE aligned left (tight splits)
- **TE is the slot** = He's the inside receiver who will razor
- **I-Formation Right** = FB + RB aligned right
- This is likely **"21 personnel"** (2 backs, 1 TE, 2 WRs)

## "Razor" Motion Clarified

**TE Razor Motion**:
- The **TE** (aligned as inside slot left) is who motions
- He "razors" across formation to block
- This is even better than WR because TE is natural blocker
- Defense really believes it's run when TE pulls across

## Why This Makes More Sense

**TE as the Razor**:
- More believable as extra blocker
- Can actually execute crack blocks better
- Sells counter run even harder
- When TE pulls across = looks like "tackle over" or pulling TE in run game

## The Corrected Call

**"21 Personnel, Tight Twins Left (TE inside), I-Right, TE Razor Motion, Counter Action, Slip-2"**

Or simplified:
**"21 Counter Razor, TE Pull, Slip-2"**

The fact that it's the TE motioning makes this play even nastier because:
1. TE pulling = maximum run sell
2. Outside WR can sell stalk block
3. Then slips on the slant
4. Defense is completely flowing away

Thanks for the clarification - TE as the razor makes way more sense than a WR for selling the run fake!

## Personnel Groupings Breakdown

**The Two-Digit System:**

**First Digit = Running Backs** (RB + FB counted together)
**Second Digit = Tight Ends**

## Examples:

**21 Personnel**
- **2** = Running backs (could be 1 RB + 1 FB)
- **1** = Tight end
- By default: 2 WRs (since 2+1+2 = 5 skill players)

**11 Personnel** (Most common in modern NFL)
- **1** = Running back
- **1** = Tight end  
- By default: 3 WRs

**12 Personnel**
- **1** = Running back
- **2** = Tight ends
- By default: 2 WRs

**00 Personnel** (Empty)
- **0** = No running backs
- **0** = No tight ends
- By default: 5 WRs

## The Math

**Always adds up to 5 skill position players:**
- (RBs) + (TEs) + (WRs) = 5
- WRs aren't stated, they're whatever is left over

## Your Formation

**"21 Personnel, Tight Twins Left, I-Right"**
- 2 backs (FB + RB in I-formation)
- 1 tight end (aligned as slot in twins)
- 2 wide receivers (one outside left, one split right)

The beauty of personnel groupings is the defense must match with their own personnel - see "21" and they'll likely stay in base defense, then you motion to spread them out!
