presnap motion to create space

first down , 7.1 average depth to target

philosophy - set up 2nd and medium, 3rd and short

so pass plays ... mean like a run play so sprint outs to the right then a curl backwards

3:10

on first down set up explosive plays, they're running zone defense get it behind the linebackers before the safety


try to avoid third down entirely by generating play action
