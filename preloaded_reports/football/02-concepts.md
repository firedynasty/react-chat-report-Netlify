## Dagger Concept

**Dagger** is a two-route combination that attacks the middle of the field:

### The Core Routes
1. **Deep Dig/Over** - 15-20 yards across the field
2. **Vertical Seam/Post** - Up the seam

These two routes create a **high-low stretch** on the middle linebacker or safety.

## How It Works

**The Conflict:**
- The seam holds the deep safety
- The dig comes in behind the linebackers
- Middle defender can't cover both

**Common Read:**
1. Peek at the seam (is safety jumping it?)
2. Main read is the dig behind it
3. Checkdown if both covered

        MLB
```

## In Your Play List

**"Sft Mtn PA Dagger Cross"** likely means:
- Play action fake
- Someone runs the deep dig/cross
- Someone else runs the seam
- "Cross" might indicate the dig comes from across formation

**Related concepts in your list:**
- **PA Deep Cross Go** - Similar deep cross with vertical
- **PA Post Dig** - Exactly dagger (post + dig)

## Why "Dagger"?

The deep dig "stabs" through the middle of the defense like a dagger - it's the primary route that kills defenses when the seam holds the safety!

Great question! Now you're getting into the actual play calling after establishing the formation and motion. Here's how route calling typically works:

## Route Tree Numbers (Most Common System)

**Standard numbering**:
- 0 = Hitch (quick stop)
- 1 = Quick slant
- 2 = Slant 
- 3 = Deep out
- 4 = Deep in (dig)
- 5 = Deep comeback
- 6 = Deep curl
- 7 = Corner/flag
- 8 = Post
- 9 = Go/Fly/Streak

## Calling Routes in Your Formation

**Your setup**: Trey left, offset right, fly motion left, X isolated right

**Common ways to call it**:

### Number System
"**324**" might mean:
- Trey side (3 receivers): Outside runs "3" (deep out)
- Middle receiver: Runs "2" (slant)
- Inside receiver: Runs "4" (dig)
- X receiver (alone): Runs specific route or converts

### Concept Names
Instead of numbers, many teams use **concept names**:
- **"Smash"** = Corner/hitch combo
- **"Flood"** = 3 levels vertical stretch
- **"Mesh"** = Crossing routes
- **"Four Verts"** = All verticals

## Full Play Call Example

**"Trey Left, Offset Right, Fly Motion Left, 324 Flood, X Curl"**

Breaking it down:
- Formation: Trey left
- Backfield: Offset right
- Motion: Fly left
- Trey routes: 3-2-4 concept
- Backside: Flood concept
- X receiver: Runs curl

## Protection Calls

Often tagged at end:
- **"525 protection"** (5 blockers, RB responsible for Mike)
- **"Jet protection"** (RB free releases)
- **"Max protect"** (7-8 blockers)

The beauty is each system is different - some teams name every route concept ("Dagger," "Scissor," "Lion"), while others use pure numbers. The key is everyone knowing their assignment within the system.

This sounds like a classic **"Yankee Concept"** or **"Deep Cross"** play with a TE delay element. Let me break down what you're describing and give you the proper name:

## The Play Breakdown

**Formation**: Trips Left
**Routes**:
- #1 (outside): Post
- #2 (middle slot): Cross 
- #3 (inside slot): Cross
- TE: Block 1 second, then release to corner

## The Play Name Options

**Most likely: "PA Yankee Delay"**
- "Yankee" = Deep crossing concept
- "Delay" = TE blocks then releases

**Could also be called**:
- **"PA Deep Cross Leak"**
- **"PA Double Cross Y-Delay"**
- **"PA Trips Yankee Corner"**

## Why "Yankee"?

**Traditional Yankee Concept**:
- Deep over/crossing route from one side
- Deep dig/cross from the other
- Creates horizontal stretch on safeties
- Your version has double crossers from trips

## The TE "Delay" Element

**TE Corner Delay**:
- Blocks for 1 count (sells pass pro)
- Then releases to corner route
- This is the "leak" or "delay" tag
- Often WIDE open as defenders forget about him

## Full Play Call

**"Trips Left, 21 PA Boot, Yankee Y-Delay Corner"**

Or simplified:
**"PA Yankee Delay"** (everyone knows their job)

## Why This Works

The crossing routes clear out the middle and pull safeties down, while the TE delay often leaves him 1-on-1 with a linebacker who can't cover the corner route. The post holds the deep safety. It's a great shot play off play action!


Perfect! Now I can see the actual **Yankee concept** drawn up. Let me break down what you're showing:

## Formation Breakdown

**"12 Personnel, 2x2 TE Splits, Gun Sidecar Right"**
- **12 Personnel**: 1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs
- **Formation**: Both TEs split out (not attached to line)
- **Backfield**: Shotgun with RB in sidecar (parallel to QB on right)

## The Yankee Concept Routes

Looking at your diagram:
- **Z (left)**: Deep over/post route (blue line)
- **Y (TE left)**: Shallow cross underneath (red arrow)
- **U (TE right)**: Deep cross/over (green dashed line)  
- **X (right)**: Likely converting to deep route
- **RB (T)**: Check protection or outlet (orange)

## The Play Call

**"12 Gun Sidecar Right, 2x2 TE Splits, Yankee"**

Or more concise:
**"12 Spread Gun, Yankee Right"**

## Why This Version Works

**The Concept**:
- **High-Low-Middle triangle** on the linebackers
- Y (TE) on shallow cross holds underneath coverage
- U (TE) on deep cross attacks middle behind LBs
- Z on post/over occupies safety
- Creates horizontal stretch across field

**TE Advantages**:
- Both TEs split out creates matchup problems
- Likely getting LBs in coverage
- TEs on crossing routes are tough to cover
- More physical on breaking routes

**"Yankee Right"** indicates the direction of the primary deep cross (coming from right to left in this case).

This is a great intermediate passing concept that attacks the middle of the field at multiple levels!

Yes, exactly! That's the **concept name** - one word that tells ALL receivers their complete route package.

## Concept Names = Complete Route Packages

When the QB says **"Smash"**, every receiver instantly knows:

**Smash Concept:**

- \#1 receiver (outside): Corner route
- \#2 receiver (inside): Hitch/Quick game
- Creates high-low stretch on corner

**No need to say:** "X run corner, Z run hitch, slot run hitch" - just say **"Smash"**!

## Common NFL Concept Names

**"Four Verts"**

- Everyone: Vertical routes
- Inside receivers have option rules

**"Mesh"**

- Two receivers: Crossing routes that "mesh"
- Others: Specific complementary routes

**"Flood"**

- Three receivers: Short, medium, deep to one side
- Creates 3-level vertical stretch

**"Dagger"**

- Slot: Deep dig/over
- Outside: Vertical seam
- Everyone knows their role

**"Stick"**

- \#1: Hitch
- \#2: "Stick" route (quick out)
- \#3: Flat

## How This Speeds Everything Up

**Instead of:** "X run 9, Z run 5, Slot run 2, TE run 6, RB check protect then release to flat"

**Just say:** "Flood" - everyone knows their job!

## Team-Specific Names

Some teams get creative:

- **"Tiger"** = Their version of Smash
- **"Lion"** = Their Flood concept
- **"Seattle"** = Four Verts
- **"NASCAR"** = Speed sweep package

The beauty is during install week, you learn "when we call Smash, I run X route from Y position" - then in the game, one word triggers everyone's assignment. It's like calling a basketball play where "UCLA" means everyone knows their cuts and screens!



Great question! In **"Motion Smash Sluggo"**, the "Smash" is likely telling you the **base concept** that most receivers run, while "Sluggo" is a **special tag** for one specific receiver.

## Breaking It Down

**"Motion Smash Sluggo"** probably means:

**Base Concept: "Smash"**

- Most receivers run normal Smash routes
- \#2 receivers: Hitches/quick game
- But ONE receiver gets a different route...

**Tagged Route: "Sluggo"**

- The #1 (outside) receiver runs Sluggo instead of corner
- Sluggo = Slant-and-Go (fake slant, break vertical)
- This replaces the normal corner route in Smash

## Why This Makes Sense

**Normal Smash:**

- Outside: Corner
- Inside: Hitch

**Smash-Sluggo:**

- Outside: **SLUGGO** (the changeup)
- Inside: Hitch (stays the same)

## The Advantage

**Defensive Expectation:**

- They see Smash formation/split
- Corner expects normal corner route
- Jumps the corner break

**The Sluggo Surprise:**

- Receiver sells slant first (corner bites)
- Then breaks vertical
- Wide open deep

## How It's Called

The full concept is "Smash" but with the "Sluggo" **tag** or **alert** changing one specific route. So:

- 3 receivers might run regular Smash
- 1 receiver (usually backside X or frontside Z) runs the Sluggo
- Everyone knows who gets the special route based on formation rules

Think of "Smash" as the base play, and "Sluggo" as the wrinkle that makes one route different - keeping the defense honest when they think they know what's coming!





## China Concept

**"China"** is a 3-level vertical stretch concept that attacks the deep, intermediate, and short zones on one side of the field.

## The Basic China Route Combo

**Three Routes (from outside in):**

1. **#1 (Outside)**: Corner or Deep Out
2. **#2 (Middle)**: Deep Dig/Over (18-20 yards)
3. **#3 (Inside)**: Shallow/Underneath (5-6 yards)

This creates a **diagonal stretch** down the field.

## Why It's Called "China"

Different theories:

- Some say it resembles the shape of China on a map
- Others say it's just a random code name
- Every team has different origins for their concept names

## How China Works

**The Read (High to Low):**

1. **Deep**: Corner route stretches the safety
2. **Intermediate**: Dig/Over in the void (money throw)
3. **Underneath**: Shallow for hot/checkdown

**The Conflict:**

- Forces defenders to cover all three levels
- Linebacker can't cover both shallow and dig
- Safety can't cover both corner and dig

## Variations

**"China Bow"**

- Add a post route from backside

**"China Drive"**

- \#2 runs a shallower dig (12-15 yards)

**"China Flood"**

- RB releases to flat for 4th option

## When to Use China

**Great against:**

- Cover 3 (attacks the levels)
- Cover 2 (dig splits the safeties)
- Works from any 3×1 or trips formation

**The Key:** China is all about that **intermediate dig route** - it's usually the primary target, with the corner holding the safety and the shallow as the outlet. It's a rhythm passing concept where the QB knows exactly where each route will be.
