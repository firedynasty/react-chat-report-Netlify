You're right to highlight that - let me clarify the "continuing motion" exception:

## Two Types of Motion

### 1. **Reset Motion**
- RB motions from right to left
- **STOPS** and gets set in new position
- Must be set for 1 full second before snap
- Now he's just in a different alignment

### 2. **Motion at the Snap** (Continuing Motion)
- RB starts motion from right to left
- **KEEPS MOVING** through the snap
- Never stops or gets set
- Ball can be snapped while he's still in motion

## The Key Rule

**Only ONE player** can be in motion at the snap, and he must be:
- Moving **parallel** to the line of scrimmage, OR
- Moving **backward** (away from the line)
- **NOT** moving forward toward the line

## Common Examples of Continuing Motion

- **Jet sweep**: WR in fast motion across formation at the snap
- **Fly sweep**: RB in motion takes handoff while running full speed
- **Motion to create trips**: Slot receiver motioning out wide as ball is snapped

This is why you'll sometimes see:
- QB doing a hard count while the RB is still motioning, timing the snap perfectly
- The RB suddenly accelerating during his motion - this is often the "jet" action for a sweep or fake

The advantage of continuing motion is that the defense has less time to adjust since the player never stops, and it can create immediate horizontal momentum for certain plays.
