Exactly! You're thinking like a QB now - the hot route is critical for beating the blitz.

## Hot Routes vs Blitz

**The "Sit" as a Hot Route**:
- RB sits right behind/between the blitzing linebackers
- Usually 4-6 yards deep in the vacated space
- QB knows EXACTLY where he'll be pre-snap
- Ball comes out in 1.5-2 seconds

## How Hot Routes Work

**Pre-snap read**:
- QB identifies potential blitzers
- Knows RB is hot if they come
- On snap: If blitz comes, immediate throw to the sit

**"Sight Adjust" concept**:
- RB sees blitz → converts to hot
- Could change from wheel to sit automatically
- Both QB and RB see the same thing

## Full Hot Route System

**"Trey Left Flood, Fly Left Sit, HOT"**

This means:
- **Primary**: Flood concept to the trey
- **RB**: Sits in space
- **HOT**: Pre-designated quick throw vs pressure

Could also call:
- **"Z Hot Slant"** - Slot receiver hot
- **"Y Hot Seam"** - TE splits defenders
- **"X Hot Hitch"** - Backside quick throw

## Where to Sit

**Behind/Between defenders**:
- Find the "window" where blitzers came from
- Usually inside the numbers
- Not too deep (keep it quick)
- Face QB immediately after sitting

## Protection Adjustment

**"Hot" protection**:
- Line knows it's quick throw
- "Big on Big" (linemen block linebackers)
- RB is outlet, not blocker
- Get 5 vertical sets to buy time

The beauty is the defense shows blitz to disrupt you, but you WANT them to blitz because the hot throw is often wide open for 6-8 yards where the linebacker vacated.
