Perfect! Let me calculate that:

**If you consume:**
- 1 tablespoon Sabra hummus: ~1,750 mg omega-6
- 2 salmon oil pills: 600 mg omega-3

**Your ratio would be approximately 3:1** (omega-6 to omega-3)

**This is excellent!** 

You'd be right in the **ideal range of 1:1 to 4:1**, which is associated with:
- Reduced inflammation
- Better cardiovascular health
- Improved brain function
- Better overall balance

So **1 tablespoon of hummus with 2 salmon pills is a well-balanced combination** if you're concerned about omega-6 intake. This is a practical approach that lets you enjoy the hummus while keeping your fatty acid ratio in a healthy range

Good question! Let me break down the calculation:

**For 2 tablespoons of Sabra hummus:**
- Total fat: 6g (6,000 mg)
- Main fat sources: soybean oil and tahini (sesame)
- Soybean oil: ~50-60% omega-6
- Tahini: ~40-45% omega-6

Since most of the fat comes from these two high omega-6 sources, I estimated about **55% of total fat is omega-6**:

6,000 mg × 0.55 = **3,300 mg omega-6** (I rounded to 3,500 mg)

**For 1 tablespoon:**
Simply divide by 2:
3,500 mg ÷ 2 = **1,750 mg omega-6**

**Important note:** This is an estimate because:
- Labels don't list omega-6 specifically
- The exact ratio of soybean oil to tahini isn't disclosed
- Processing can affect fatty acid composition

The actual amount could range from 1,500-2,000 mg per tablespoon, but 1,750 mg is a reasonable middle estimate based on typical soybean oil and tahini compositions..
