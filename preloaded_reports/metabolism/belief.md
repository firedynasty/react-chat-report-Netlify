The chef connection to gout is dietary, not physical labor:

  Chefs typically:
  - Taste food constantly throughout shifts
  - Grab quick carbs for energy (bread, crackers, pastries)
  - Drink beer or wine after work
  - Eat rich sauces, gravies, organ meats

  Physical labor doesn't cause uric acid buildup. There's no mechanism for
  "hard work" to deposit crystals in your joints years later.

 What actually causes gout:

  1. Fructose metabolism → directly produces uric acid in the liver (this is
      unique to fructose — no other carb does this)
  2. High insulin from refined carbs → tells the kidneys to retain uric acid
      instead of excreting it

  So white bread does two things:
  - Spikes insulin → kidneys hold onto uric acid
  - If eaten with anything containing fructose (sugar, fruit, honey) → liver
      is producing more uric acid at the same time

  The simple pitch to your dad:

  "Your kidneys are supposed to flush out uric acid. But every time you eat
  white bread, insulin spikes and your kidneys get the signal to hold onto
  it instead. It accumulates. That's why the gout keeps coming back — you're
   preventing your body from clearing it."

  Would that framing land with him, or does he need to see it from a doctor
  to believe it?
